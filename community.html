    <h2>Community Involvement and Accomplishments</h2>
    <h3>Understood Blog</h3>
	<h4>(2015)</h4>
	<p><a href="understood.org" target="_blank">Understood.org</a> is a national partnership of 15 nonprofit organizations, coming together to support parents of the one in five children with learning and attention issues throughout their journey. Based on my dyslexia advocacy on Capital Hill, the National Center for Learning Disabilities' Public Policy Director expressed an interest in interviewing me for a Social Media post.  In December, Understood.org posted <a href="https://www.understood.org/en/community-events/blogs/making-a-difference/2015/12/22/teen-tech-whiz-with-dyslexia-shares-his-expertise-to-help-others" target="_blank">this interview</a> on their Facebook Page, and it receive one of their highest ‘likes’ in their posting history.  The article has open the doors to my Assistive Technology Consulting Business, and I now have a few more clients from across the U.S. that I Skype with for virtual tutoring.</p>
	<h3>Nomination and Finalist for the International Dyslexia Association (IDA) Remy Johnston Award</h3>
    <h4>(2015)</h4>
    <p>The IDA Remy Johnston Award is presented each year to an individual student (high school or college age) with dyslexia who "refuses to be limited by the challenges of learning differences, strives for excellence, chooses to live life as an achiever and role model for others, and continues to enrich the lives of families, friends, employers and the community in which s/he lives through service." This year, I was nominated by 11 people in our community, which included the the President of the District of Columbia's IDA branch, our Arlington Public School's Director of Special Education, my Special Education teacher and many other parents that have gotten to know me from various dyslexia awareness and training sessions during which I have presented information about dyslexia and Assistive Technology. <a href="media/RemyJohnstonRecommendation.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see my letters of recommendation for which I was humbled to receive.</a> <a href="media/RemyJohnstonEssay.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to see my personal essay describing my journey with dyslexia.</a></p>

    <h3>Decoding Dyslexia Capital Hill Days</h3>
    <h4>(July 2015)</h4>
    <p>Decoding Dyslexia is a network of parent-led grassroots movements across the country concerned with limited access to educational instruction for dyslexic students in public education. Since my sister and I founded More Than Dyslexics, I've had the opportunity to network with our Decoding Dyslexia's Virginia Chapter over the past two years. In addition to a few local awareness and support group meetings, I have attended three formal Congressional Hearings to support new legislation. In July 2015, Decoding Dyslexia arranged their second annual Capital Hill Days event. Representatives from each of the 50 Decoding Dyslexia states gathered on Capital Hill to advocate for legislative changes to help support students in public schools with dyslexia. I had the opportunity to meet with Congressman Dave Brat (VA), the legislative assistant from Congressman Don Beyer's office (VA) and the legislative assistant from Congressman Scott Perry's office (PA).</p>

    <h3>Assistive Technology and Dyslexia Training for Arlington Public Schools</h3>
    <h4>(2013, 2014, 2015)</h4>
    <p>May 2013: One of three presenters in the Dyslexia Training Institutes's "Dyslexia for a Day" simulation hosted by the Arlington Special Education Advisory Committee. Attendees learned about the neurological basis of dyslexia and experienced what it is like to be an individual struggling with dyslexia, through reading and writing simulations. I was also able to share my experiences about what it feels like to be in a classroom with this hidden disability. </p>
    <p>May 2014 and May 2015: One of three presenters in APS's Dyslexia Training for Parents and APS Staff, hosted by the Parent Resource Center. I had the opportunity to present and discuss how Assistive Technology can help students accommodate for dyslexia <a href="media/training.pdf" target="_blank">(click here to see my handout)</a>. Over 200 people attended these training session.</p>
    <p>May 2015: School Board Work Session on Technology. Based on my prior involvement with APS's Training Sessions, our Superintendent invited me to speak at our School Board's Work Session on Technology. APS is 1 year into a 4 year plan to provide every 2nd grade - 12th grade student with their own APS issued device (iPad or Macbook air). My presentation not only focused on how Special Education students benefit from Assistive Technology, but also how every student can use their devices to improve their organization, reading and writing skills. <a href="media/school_board.pdf" target="_blank">(Click here to see my handout)</a>. </p>

    <h3>Multi Modal Transportations and Student Safety Special Committee</h3>
	<h4>(January 2013 - June 2014)</h4>
    <p>In September 2012, Arlington Public Schools reconfigured our school bus routes and service, and as a result, hundreds of students were no longer eligible for bus transportation. Due to the community concern for safety and transportation options for students that erupted, the Arlington School Board established the Multimodal Transportation and Student Safety Special Committee (MMTSSSC) to report to the School Board to provide recommendations regarding the safe transportation of students to and from school by a variety of modes of transportation.</p>
    <p>The overarching goal of the MTSSSC is to ensure student safety for all forms of transportation, including but not limited to walking, bus transportation, bicycling, and driving. Additional goals are to provide on-time bus service; to maximize efficient use of APS transportation resources; to ensure a reasonable walk distance to each school; to support effective traffic management at school sites; to make informed decisions that reflect the APS dedication to environmental stewardship; and to consider and report budget implications for any Committee recommendations.</p>
    <p>The MMTSSC met approximately every two weeks for 18 months, and presented a Recommending Report to our School Board in June 2014 <a href="http://www.apsva.us/cms/lib2/VA01000586/Centricity/Domain/161/MMTSSSC%20Final%20Report%20Report%20to%20SB%20-%20June%202014.pdf" target="blank">(linked here)</a></p>
    <p>There were 13 Voting Committee Members from the Community appointed to the MMTSSSC, which included two students <a href="media/MMTSSSC.pdf" target="_blank">(click here to see my letters of recomendation to be appointed to the committee)</a>, and eight additional APS and Arlington County Staff who supported the Committee's work, which included the Arlington County Director of Transportation and the APS Assistant Superintendent of Facilities and Operations.</p>
