    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img class="experience_photo" src="media/family.jpg" alt="JRO FAMILY PHOTO">
    <p>I have lived in the metropolitan D.C. area for my whole life with my parents and two younger sisters. Currently, I am a Senior at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia. I've been in Arlington Public Schools since my 7th grade year.</p>
    <p>Prior to living in Arlington, I lived in Vienna, VA. There I attended public school from Kindergarten until the 3rd grade when I was identified as being dyslexic. Dyslexia is an unexpected difficulty learning to read that involves phonological processing despite intelligence, motivation and education. For 4th grade, I was homeschooled, and for 5th - 6th grade, I attended a small private school for gifted students (The Edlin School) in Reston, VA. Many people choose to view dyslexia as a disability, but being dyslexic has been centric to many of my projects. It has also given me the ability to see a challenge from another perspective.</p>
