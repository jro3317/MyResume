    <p>In January, 2015, I started working as a host at <a href="http://ebbitt.com" target="_blank">The Old Ebbitt Grill</a> in downtown D.C.. The Old Ebbitt Grill is Washington DC’s oldest saloon and serves over 2,000 guests each day with sales volume that ranks 3rd in the nation. It is also located less than a block from the White House, which means that we see a wide range of clientele. On an average day at The Ebbitt we will serve anyone from a tourist to a Supreme Court Justice. It has been a great experience for me as I have been able to learn how to interact with customers with a wide range of expectations for service.</p>

    <h3>More Than Dyslexics</h3>
    <h4>(July 2014 - Present)</h4>
    <img class="experience_photo" src="media/MTD.jpg" alt="MTD GROUP SHOT">
    <p>In 2013, my sister was also diagnosed as being dyslexic (it's hereditary). I realized that she did not have the same technical and self advocacy skills that I had been developing over several years. I realized that I had developed a knowledge base of how to accommodate for dyslexia and that I needed to share some of it with a broader audience. Together, we came up with the idea of starting a support group for students with dyslexia. In 2014, we founded <a href="http://www.morethandyslexics.com" target="_blank">More Than Dyslexics</a>. More Than Dyslexics is a group of mostly secondary school students who all have reading or writing disabilities, but more importantly, we want others to realize that we want to be recognized for more than our weaknesses. It was a great experience when our local newspaper interviewed my sister and me for a featured article about MTD <a href="links/Arlington_Connection.pdf" target="_blank">(click here to view the article)</a>. We have been able to hold four events so far where our members are able to get together and mostly meet other kids going through similar challenges. MTD has played Lazer Tag, gone bowling, ice skating, capture the flag, and had the opportunity to hear from a local dyslexic author. We have been able to create a mailing list of over one hundred email addresses from our website. It was great for my sister and I to see how quickly a group like this was able to catch on. We have also been introduced to a diverse group of kids from surrounding counties, some of which have driven upwards of one hour to get to our events. We are planning another event for November.</p>

    <h3>Assistive Technology Consulting</h3>
    <h4>(Summer 2014 - Present)</h4>
    <p>As I became more involved in the dyslexia community, I realized that I had a knack for using technology to help overcome the disability of dyslexia. I began taking on a few student clients and showing them how to best use pieces of technology to overcome their weaknesses. It has been extremely successful and I have been able to help a handful of kids privately as well as participate in larger presentations and spread my knowledge to larger groups.</p>

    <h3>Nancy Van Doren for Arlington's School Board Election</h3>
    <h4>(November 2013 - November 2014)</h4>

    <p>In the fall of 2013, our County’s former Special Education Advisory Committee Chair, Nancy Van Doren, decided to run for an open seat on our county's school board. Nancy had never done anything like this so she knew that she would need some help navigating the campaign. Nancy knew I had a strong technology background, and approached me for help creating a website and all the infrastructure to accept online donations as well as sending email blasts. As her IT Manager for the Campaign Team, which include nine other adults serving in various roles, I was responsible for creating and maintaining her website, designing the campaign logo, managing the supporter database (we had over 750 supporters), managing the Paypal account (we raised approximately $25,000), attending Campaign meetings and communicating on a weekly basis, and introducing her for her official campaign announcement at our county's monthly Democratic Committee meeting (approximately 300 people in attendance). Her campaign took 1 year, from inception to winning the election.</p>

    <h3>Apogee Technology Services</h3>
    <h4>(Summer 2013, Summer 2014, Summer 2015)</h4>

Apogee provides services from simple troubleshooting and maintenance to complex installations and migrations.

    <p><a href="http://eventfarm.com" target="_blank">Event Farm</a> was founded in 2004 and provides event marketing software platforms for some of the world's most innovative companies. In the summer of 2012, I worked as an intern in their newly opened D.C. office.

    <h3>Lacrosse</h3>
    <h4>(March 2010 - November 2014)</h4>
    <img class="experience_photo" style="padding-bottom:20px;" src="media/lax.jpg" alt="LACROSSE PHOTO">
    <p>I first started playing Lacrosse on our local youth league when I was 12 years old. I immediately loved the fast action and strategy of the game. I continued to play on youth association teams, until 8th grade, when I tried out and made the Yorktown High School's Junior Varsity team. It was a great experience playing for the High School team as an 8th grader. During my 9th, 10th and Fall of my 11th grade years, I continued to play lacrosse for the Yorktown's Junior Varsity and Varsity teams.</p>
